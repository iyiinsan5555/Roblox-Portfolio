                I’m a Software Engineering student with classes taught in English, building clean, modular, and scalable code.
                I’m constantly learning new programming languages and best practices, take my projects seriously, and enjoy collaborating with a team.
                I embrace mistakes as opportunities to improve and am always eager to create, contribute, and grow.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
               I’m an 18-year-old Software Engineering student with a passion for building clean, modular, robust, and scalable code.
               My university classes are taught in English, which makes me confident in communication and collaboration.
               I’m able to build systems such as combat, round-based, FPS, and simulator systems from scratch, and I enjoy solving problems rather than copying and pasting solutions.
               If you have an idea, feel free to ask — just give me time and let me cook.
               I currently dedicate around 5 hours a day (about 40 hours a week) to Roblox development.
               I started my Roblox development journey around four years ago, with a long break in between, so while I’m not claiming to be a senior professional, my university background and strong interest in programming put me ahead of many beginners.
               I take my projects seriously, enjoy working in a team, learn from my mistakes, and I’m always focused on improving and growing as an engineer.

                I’m currently offering my services for free to gain experience and improve my skills.
                My focus is on delivering clean, modular, and well-structured code for Roblox games.
                I treat every project seriously and aim to communicate clearly, meet deadlines, and collaborate effectively.
                While I don’t charge at the moment, I expect a clear project brief and constructive feedback to help me grow as an engineer.
