                I’m a Software Engineering student with classes taught in English, building clean, modular, and scalable code.
                I’m constantly learning new programming languages and best practices, take my projects seriously, and enjoy collaborating with a team.
                I embrace mistakes as opportunities to improve and am always eager to create, contribute, and grow.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
               I’m an 18-year-old Software Engineering student with a passion for building clean, modular, robust, and scalable code.
               My university classes are taught in English, which makes me confident in communication and collaboration.
               I’m able to build systems such as combat, round-based, FPS, and simulator systems (and more) from scratch, and I enjoy solving problems rather than copying and pasting solutions.
               If you have an idea, feel free to ask — just give me time and let me cook.
               I currently dedicate around 5 hours a day (about 40 hours a week) to Roblox development.
               I started my Roblox development journey around four years ago, with a long break in between, so while I’m not claiming to be a senior professional, my university background and strong interest in programming put me ahead of many beginners.
               I take my projects seriously, enjoy working in a team, learn from my mistakes, and I’m always focused on improving and growing as an engineer.

                Send me a friend request on Discord.
                If I’m available (which is usually the case), I’ll accept it and wait you to share a detailed description of your commission.
                After reviewing your request, I’ll conduct a feasibility assessment to determine whether the project is achievable based on your requirements.
                During this process, I may ask a few clarifying questions.
               If everything looks good, I’ll be happy to take on the project free of charge for now, as I’m currently in a learning and growth phase.
            </p>

            <h1>Commissions</h1>
            <p>
                I prefer payment in Robux, and pricing is open to discussion.
                I provide video demonstrations of the product before final delivery (or a test game if the project is too advanced).
                Once payment is completed, the final product will be delivered promptly.
