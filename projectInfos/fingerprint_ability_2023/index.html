            <p>
                My dear first commission. After getting paid out I was the happiest man alive :>]. What did i do?
                <span style="display: block;">I created a framework for scaleable ability management (I made better one in 2026). I renders vfx for all clients but not for server. Why? Because we do not want to occupy server unnecessarily. When user triggers the ability server checks user's condition and create ability or not. If others is in near they see the vfx that is created by ability (move).</span>
