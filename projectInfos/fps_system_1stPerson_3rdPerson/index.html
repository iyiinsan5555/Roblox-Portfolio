            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                I had made so many features like:
                <span style="display: block;">Viewmodel automaticly created from player's character and it is animatable.</span>
                <span style="display: block;">When player's gun collides with a wall it does not fire.</span>
                <span style="display: block;">Everything was scalable and modular. What I mean: You were able to change everything from model's attributes. You do not even need to open a single script.</span>
                <span style="display: block;"></span>
                <p>Also I remember that I improved my knowledge about boundary-querying functions.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I have used a lot of external sources + OOP. Thus it was modular and scalable.</p>
            </p>
